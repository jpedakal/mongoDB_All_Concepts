--> Indexes support the efficient execution of queries in MongoDB. 
--> Without indexes, MongoDB must perform a collection scan, i.e. scan every document in a collection, 
    to select those documents that match the query statement. 
--> If an appropriate index exists for a query, MongoDB can use the index to limit the number of documents 
    it must inspect.


--> MongoDB creates a unique index on the _id field during the creation of a collection.
--> The _id index prevents clients from inserting two documents with the same value for the _id field. 
--> You cannot drop this index on the _id field.
--> To create an index using the Node.JS driver, use createIndex().
