Aggregation operations process data records and return computed results. 

Aggregation operations group values from multiple documents together, and can perform a variety of 
operations on the grouped data to return a single result. 

MongoDB provides three ways to perform aggregation: 
   --> aggregation pipeline 
   --> map-reduce function
   --> single purpose aggregation.
