* Sharding is a method for distributing data across multiple machines. MongoDB uses sharding to support deployments with very large data sets and high throughput    operations.

* Database systems with large data sets or high throughput applications can challenge the capacity of a single server. 
* For example, high query rates can exhaust the CPU capacity of the server. Working set sizes larger than the system's RAM stress the I/O capacity of disk drives.
* There are two methods for addressing system growth: vertical and horizontal scaling.

<b>Vertical Scaling</b> 
* Involves increasing the capacity of a single server, such as using a more powerful CPU, adding more RAM, or increasing the amount of storage space. 
* Limitations in available technology may restrict a single machine from being sufficiently powerful for a given workload. 
* Additionally, Cloud-based providers have hard ceilings based on available hardware configurations. As a result, there is a practical maximum for vertical scaling.

<b>Horizontal Scaling</b>
* Involves dividing the system dataset and load over multiple servers, adding additional servers to increase capacity as required. 
* While the overall speed or capacity of a single machine may not be high, each machine handles a subset of the overall workload, potentially providing better efficiency than a single high-speed high-capacity server. 
* Expanding the capacity of the deployment only requires adding additional servers as needed, which can be a lower overall cost than high-end hardware for a single machine. The trade off is increased complexity in infrastructure and maintenance for the deployment.
