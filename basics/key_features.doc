High Performance
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MongoDB provides high performance data persistence. In particular,

  --> Support for embedded data models reduces I/O activity on database system.
  --> Indexes support faster queries and can include keys from embedded documents and arrays.


Rich Query Language
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MongoDB supports a rich query language to support read and write operations (CRUD) as well as:

  --> Data Aggregation
  --> Text Search and Geospatial Queries.


High Availability
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MongoDBâ€™s replication facility, called replica set, provides:

--> automatic failover
--> data redundancy.
A replica set is a group of MongoDB servers that maintain the same data set, providing redundancy and 
increasing data availability.


Horizontal Scalability
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MongoDB provides horizontal scalability as part of its core functionality:

--> Sharding distributes data across a cluster of machines.
--> Starting in 3.4, MongoDB supports creating zones of data based on the shard key. In a balanced cluster, 
    MongoDB directs reads and writes covered by a zone only to those shards inside the zone. 
    See the Zones manual page for more information.


Support for Multiple Storage Engines
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MongoDB supports multiple storage engines:

--> WiredTiger Storage Engine (including support for Encryption at Rest)
--> In-Memory Storage Engine.

In addition, MongoDB provides pluggable storage engine API that allows third parties to develop 
storage engines for MongoDB.
